# homedepot

I wanted to teach myself gradient boosted tree. They have shown promising results in winning Kaggle competiton. 
In this repository, I used the Gradient Boosted Tree to solve the Kaggle Challenge for home depot. 

I do not remember the problem completly. But it was something like, a user [s]he made some search on home depot website, some results were presented to her. Our goal is to determine, how good are the results that were presented to her. I used the features such as "lenght of queries", "length of product description", "common words between the description and queries", and "Jackard Similarity between the description and search".

I used the Random Forest, Bagging Tree, and, Xtreme Gradient Boosted Tree. My score was highest from the XGBoosted Tree.
